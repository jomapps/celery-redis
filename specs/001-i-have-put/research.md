# Research: AI Movie Platform - Celery/Redis Task Service

## Research Summary
All technical unknowns have been resolved through analysis of the detailed requirements in `docs/thoughts/what.md`. The research confirms the technology stack choices and identifies best practices for implementation.

## Technology Decisions

### Python 3.11 with FastAPI
**Decision**: Use Python 3.11 with FastAPI for the REST API server  
**Rationale**: 
- FastAPI provides excellent async performance for I/O-bound operations
- Native support for OpenAPI/Swagger documentation
- Built-in validation with Pydantic models
- Type hints improve code quality and IDE support
**Alternatives considered**: Flask (less built-in features), Django (too heavy for API-only service)

### Celery with Redis
**Decision**: Use Celery 5.3+ with Redis as both broker and result backend  
**Rationale**:
- Celery is the de facto standard for distributed task processing in Python
- Redis provides excellent performance for both message brokering and result storage
- Built-in support for task retries, routing, and monitoring
- Horizontal scaling capabilities for worker processes
**Alternatives considered**: RQ (simpler but less feature-rich), AWS SQS (vendor lock-in)

### GPU Task Management
**Decision**: Use CUDA with PyTorch/TensorFlow for GPU operations  
**Rationale**:
- CUDA provides direct GPU memory management
- PyTorch/TensorFlow have established patterns for model loading and inference
- Memory pooling reduces allocation overhead
- Support for multiple GPU devices
**Alternatives considered**: OpenCL (less ecosystem support), CPU-only (insufficient performance)

### Cloud Storage Integration
**Decision**: Use Cloudflare R2 with boto3-compatible client  
**Rationale**:
- S3-compatible API allows use of established boto3 patterns
- Cost-effective for large media file storage
- Global CDN distribution for fast access
- No egress fees for data retrieval
**Alternatives considered**: AWS S3 (higher costs), Google Cloud Storage (different API)

### PayloadCMS Integration
**Decision**: Use httpx for async HTTP client to PayloadCMS API  
**Rationale**:
- Async support matches FastAPI's async model
- Better performance than requests for concurrent operations
- Built-in HTTP/2 support
- Clean API for file uploads
**Alternatives considered**: requests (blocking), aiohttp (more complex API)

## Architecture Patterns

### Project Isolation Strategy
**Decision**: Use project-based task routing and data segmentation  
**Rationale**:
- Celery task routing can direct project tasks to specific queues
- Redis namespacing for project-specific data storage
- File path prefixing for project-specific media storage
- Simple to implement and maintain
**Alternatives considered**: Separate Redis instances per project (resource overhead), multi-tenancy at DB level (more complex)

### Error Handling and Retries
**Decision**: Implement custom retry logic with exponential backoff  
**Rationale**:
- Different error types require different retry strategies
- GPU memory errors need longer backoff than network errors
- Circuit breaker pattern for external service failures
- Comprehensive error categorization and reporting
**Alternatives considered**: Celery default retries (less sophisticated), No retries (poor reliability)

### Monitoring and Observability
**Decision**: Use Prometheus metrics with structured logging  
**Rationale**:
- Standard metrics collection for containerized environments
- Custom metrics for GPU utilization and task performance
- Structured JSON logs for log aggregation systems
- Integration with existing monitoring infrastructure
**Alternatives considered**: Custom metrics endpoint (non-standard), Basic logging (insufficient observability)

## Implementation Best Practices

### FastAPI Service Structure
- Use dependency injection for shared services (Redis client, PayloadCMS client)
- Implement middleware for authentication and request logging
- Use Pydantic models for request/response validation
- Separate route handlers from business logic

### Celery Worker Organization
- Base task class for common functionality (logging, monitoring, project isolation)
- Separate task modules by domain (video, image, audio)
- Worker pools for different resource requirements
- Graceful shutdown handling for long-running tasks

### Testing Strategy
- Contract tests for all API endpoints using OpenAPI schema validation
- Integration tests for complete task workflows
- Unit tests for business logic and utility functions
- Mock external services (PayloadCMS, R2) for isolated testing

### Security Considerations
- API key authentication for all external requests
- Input validation and sanitization for all task parameters
- File path validation to prevent directory traversal
- Rate limiting for task submission endpoints

## Performance Optimizations

### GPU Memory Management
- Pre-load models during worker startup
- Implement model caching with LRU eviction
- Monitor GPU memory usage and implement cleanup
- Use GPU memory pools for allocation efficiency

### Task Queue Optimization
- Priority-based routing for urgent tasks
- Task batching for similar operations
- Worker autoscaling based on queue depth
- Result compression for large media metadata

### Network and I/O
- Connection pooling for Redis and HTTP clients
- Async file operations for large media uploads
- Streaming uploads for better memory efficiency
- CDN integration for media delivery

## Risk Mitigation

### Single Points of Failure
- Redis clustering for high availability
- Multiple worker nodes for redundancy
- Health checks and automatic failover
- Backup and recovery procedures

### Resource Exhaustion
- GPU memory monitoring and limits
- Task timeout enforcement
- Queue size limits and backpressure
- Resource usage alerts and notifications

### External Service Dependencies
- Circuit breaker pattern for PayloadCMS integration
- Retry policies with exponential backoff
- Fallback storage options for critical failures
- Service degradation modes

## Next Steps
All research objectives have been completed. The technology stack is well-defined and best practices have been identified. Ready to proceed to Phase 1 design and contract generation.
