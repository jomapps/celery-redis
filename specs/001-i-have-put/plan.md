# Implementation Plan: AI Movie Platform - Celery/Redis Task Service

**Branch**: `001-i-have-put` | **Date**: 2025-09-24 | **Spec**: [spec.md](./spec.md)
**Input**: Feature specification from `/specs/001-i-have-put/spec.md`

## Execution Flow (/plan command scope)
```
1. Load feature spec from Input path
   → If not found: ERROR "No feature spec at {path}"
2. Fill Technical Context (scan for NEEDS CLARIFICATION)
   → Detect Project Type from context (web=frontend+backend, mobile=app+api)
   → Set Structure Decision based on project type
3. Fill the Constitution Check section based on the content of the constitution document.
4. Evaluate Constitution Check section below
   → If violations exist: Document in Complexity Tracking
   → If no justification possible: ERROR "Simplify approach first"
   → Update Progress Tracking: Initial Constitution Check
5. Execute Phase 0 → research.md
   → If NEEDS CLARIFICATION remain: ERROR "Resolve unknowns"
6. Execute Phase 1 → contracts, data-model.md, quickstart.md, agent-specific template file (e.g., `CLAUDE.md` for Claude Code, `.github/copilot-instructions.md` for GitHub Copilot, `GEMINI.md` for Gemini CLI, `QWEN.md` for Qwen Code or `AGENTS.md` for opencode).
7. Re-evaluate Constitution Check section
   → If new violations: Refactor design, return to Phase 1
   → Update Progress Tracking: Post-Design Constitution Check
8. Plan Phase 2 → Describe task generation approach (DO NOT create tasks.md)
9. STOP - Ready for /tasks command
```

**IMPORTANT**: The /plan command STOPS at step 7. Phases 2-4 are executed by other commands:
- Phase 2: /tasks command creates tasks.md
- Phase 3-4: Implementation execution (manual or via tools)

## Summary
A standalone GPU-intensive task processing service for AI movie production platform. Handles video generation, image creation, audio synthesis, and other computationally expensive operations with project-based isolation and result integration with PayloadCMS. The system uses Celery with Redis for distributed task processing, FastAPI for the REST API, and integrates with cloud storage (Cloudflare R2) for media file management.

## Technical Context
**Language/Version**: Python 3.11+ (constitutional requirement for type hints)  
**Primary Dependencies**: FastAPI, Celery, Redis, uvicorn, httpx, pydantic  
**Storage**: Redis (task queue & results), Cloudflare R2 (media files), PayloadCMS integration  
**Testing**: pytest, contract tests, integration tests (constitutional TDD requirement)  
**Target Platform**: Linux server with GPU support (CUDA)
**Project Type**: single (standalone service)  
**Performance Goals**: 300min max task processing time, unlimited concurrency  
**Constraints**: GPU memory management, project isolation, media file size handling  
**Scale/Scope**: Multiple concurrent GPU tasks, project-based isolation, webhook integrations

## Constitution Check
*GATE: Must pass before Phase 0 research. Re-check after Phase 1 design.*

**Status**: PASS - Constitution v1.0.0 compliance verified:
- **Service-First Architecture**: Standalone service with clear API boundaries (FastAPI)
- **Test-First Development**: TDD enforced with contract and integration tests before implementation
- **Integration Standards**: PayloadCMS 3.56+ local API patterns, Cloudflare R2 S3-compatible storage
- **Performance and Reliability**: 300min task limits, GPU resource monitoring, retry mechanisms
- **Security and Isolation**: Project-based isolation, API key authentication, input validation

**Structure Decision**: Option 1 (Single project) - Standalone service architecture

## Phase 0: Outline & Research
1. **Extract unknowns from Technical Context** above:
   - For each NEEDS CLARIFICATION → research task
   - For each dependency → best practices task
   - For each integration → patterns task

2. **Generate and dispatch research agents**:
   ```
   For each unknown in Technical Context:
     Task: "Research {unknown} for {feature context}"
   For each technology choice:
     Task: "Find best practices for {tech} in {domain}"
   ```

3. **Consolidate findings** in `research.md` using format:
   - Decision: [what was chosen]
   - Rationale: [why chosen]
   - Alternatives considered: [what else evaluated]

**Output**: research.md with all NEEDS CLARIFICATION resolved

## Phase 1: Design & Contracts
*Prerequisites: research.md complete*

1. **Extract entities from feature spec** → `data-model.md`:
   - Entity name, fields, relationships
   - Validation rules from requirements
   - State transitions if applicable

2. **Generate API contracts** from functional requirements:
   - For each user action → endpoint
   - Use standard REST/GraphQL patterns
   - Output OpenAPI/GraphQL schema to `/contracts/`

3. **Generate contract tests** from contracts:
   - One test file per endpoint
   - Assert request/response schemas
   - Tests must fail (no implementation yet)

4. **Extract test scenarios** from user stories:
   - Each story → integration test scenario
   - Quickstart test = story validation steps

5. **Update agent file incrementally** (O(1) operation):
   - Run `.specify/scripts/powershell/update-agent-context.ps1 -AgentType claude`
     **IMPORTANT**: Execute it exactly as specified above. Do not add or remove any arguments.
   - If exists: Add only NEW tech from current plan
   - Preserve manual additions between markers
   - Update recent changes (keep last 3)
   - Keep under 150 lines for token efficiency
   - Output to repository root

**Output**: data-model.md, /contracts/*, failing tests, quickstart.md, agent-specific file

## Phase 2: Task Planning Approach
*This section describes what the /tasks command will do - DO NOT execute during /plan*

**Task Generation Strategy**:
- Load `.specify/templates/tasks-template.md` as base
- Generate tasks from Phase 1 design docs (contracts, data model, quickstart)
- API contract tests from OpenAPI specification (7 endpoints) → 7 contract test tasks [P]
- Data model entities (6 core entities) → 6 model creation tasks [P]
- User scenarios from spec (5 acceptance scenarios) → 5 integration test tasks
- Infrastructure setup tasks (Redis, Celery, FastAPI) → 4 setup tasks
- Implementation tasks for each API endpoint → 7 implementation tasks
- Worker task implementations (video, image, audio) → 3 worker implementation tasks
- External integration tasks (PayloadCMS, R2) → 2 integration tasks

**Ordering Strategy**:
- TDD order: Tests before implementation (constitutional requirement)
- Dependency order: Infrastructure → Models → Services → API endpoints → Workers → Integrations
- Mark [P] for parallel execution within each layer
- Critical path: Redis setup → Celery config → Base task model → Worker implementations

**Task Categories**:
1. **Infrastructure Setup** (4 tasks): Redis, Celery, FastAPI app, Docker configuration
2. **Contract Tests** (7 tasks): One per API endpoint, parallel execution
3. **Data Models** (6 tasks): Core entities, parallel after infrastructure
4. **API Implementation** (7 tasks): Endpoint implementations to pass contract tests
5. **Worker Implementation** (3 tasks): Task processors for video/image/audio
6. **External Integrations** (2 tasks): PayloadCMS and Cloudflare R2 clients
7. **Integration Tests** (5 tasks): End-to-end scenario validation
8. **Deployment** (2 tasks): Docker packaging and deployment configuration

**Estimated Output**: 51 numbered, ordered tasks in tasks.md

**Dependencies Map**:
- All contract tests depend on infrastructure setup
- API implementations depend on their respective contract tests
- Worker implementations depend on base task model and external integrations
- Integration tests depend on all API and worker implementations

**IMPORTANT**: This phase is executed by the /tasks command, NOT by /plan

## Phase 3+: Future Implementation
*These phases are beyond the scope of the /plan command*

**Phase 3**: Task execution (/tasks command creates tasks.md)  
**Phase 4**: Implementation (execute tasks.md following constitutional principles)  
**Phase 5**: Validation (run tests, execute quickstart.md, performance validation)

## Complexity Tracking
*Fill ONLY if Constitution Check has violations that must be justified*

| Violation | Why Needed | Simpler Alternative Rejected Because |
|-----------|------------|-------------------------------------|
| [e.g., 4th project] | [current need] | [why 3 projects insufficient] |
| [e.g., Repository pattern] | [specific problem] | [why direct DB access insufficient] |
