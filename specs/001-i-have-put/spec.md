## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
An AI movie production platform needs to offload computationally expensive tasks (video generation, image creation, audio synthesis) to a dedicated processing service. The main application submits tasks with project-specific data, monitors progress, and retrieves completed media files that are automatically integrated back into the content management system.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** a main application with an AI movie project, **When** submitting a video generation task with storyboard data, **Then** the system queues the task and returns a tracking ID with estimated completion time
2. **Given** a queued video generation task, **When** checking task status, **Then** the system returns current progress percentage and processing step
3. **Given** a completed task, **When** retrieving results, **Then** the system provides direct access to generated media and confirms integration with content management system
4. **Given** multiple projects running simultaneously, **When** tasks are submitted from different projects, **Then** each project's tasks are isolated and cannot access other projects' data
5. **Given** a failed task due to GPU memory issues, **When** the system detects the failure, **Then** the task is automatically retried with appropriate backoff timing

### Edge Cases
- What happens when GPU resources are exhausted and new tasks are submitted?
- How does the system handle tasks that exceed maximum processing time limits?
- What occurs when the content management system is unavailable during result upload?
- How are tasks managed when a worker process crashes during execution?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST accept task submissions with project identification, task type, and task-specific parameters
- **FR-002**: System MUST provide real-time task status monitoring including progress percentage and current processing step
- **FR-003**: System MUST isolate tasks by project to prevent cross-project data access
- **FR-004**: System MUST support video generation tasks that produce 7-second video segments from storyboard inputs
- **FR-005**: System MUST support image generation tasks for character designs and scene elements
- **FR-006**: System MUST support audio synthesis tasks for character voices and scene audio
- **FR-007**: System MUST automatically upload completed media to content management system with proper metadata
- **FR-008**: System MUST implement automatic task retry with exponential backoff for recoverable failures
- **FR-009**: System MUST provide task cancellation capability for queued and in-progress tasks
- **FR-010**: System MUST support task prioritization with high, normal, and low priority levels
- **FR-011**: System MUST send webhook notifications to callback URLs when tasks complete or fail
- **FR-012**: System MUST maintain task history and results for project-based retrieval
- **FR-013**: System MUST authenticate all requests using API key validation
- **FR-014**: System MUST track and report GPU resource utilization and task performance metrics
- **FR-015**: System MUST handle multiple concurrent tasks across available GPU resources

### Non-Functional Requirements
- **NFR-001**: System MUST process video generation tasks within maximum time limit of 300min
- **NFR-002**: System MUST support concurrent processing of no limit
- **NFR-003**: System MUST maintain uptime/availability requirements not required at this point
- **NFR-004**: System MUST scale to handle expected task volume and growth projections not provided at this time. not required

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **Task**: Represents a processing job with type (video/image/audio), project association, parameters, status, and results
- **Project**: Isolation boundary containing related tasks and media assets with access controls
- **Media Result**: Generated content with metadata including file location, processing details, and integration status
- **Task Queue**: Ordered collection of pending tasks with priority and resource allocation
- **Worker Status**: Information about available processing resources and current workload
- **Processing Progress**: Real-time status updates including completion percentage and current operation

- [x] Key concepts extracted
- [x] Ambiguities marked
- [x] User scenarios defined
- [x] Requirements generated
- [x] Entities identified

---

## Dependencies and Assumptions

### External Dependencies
- Content management system (PayloadCMS) availability for media upload
- Cloud storage service (Cloudflare R2) for media file storage
- GPU hardware resources for intensive processing tasks

### Assumptions
- Main application has established project management and user authentication
- Generated media files require persistent storage with public access URLs
- Task processing requirements justify dedicated GPU infrastructure
- Project isolation is sufficient at application level without additional security layers

---

## Clarifications Needed

The following items require stakeholder input before implementation planning:

1. **Task Timeout Limits**: What is the maximum acceptable processing time for each task type?
2. **Concurrency Limits**: How many simultaneous tasks should the system support per project and globally?
3. **Availability Requirements**: What uptime and reliability targets are required for production use?
4. **Scalability Targets**: What is the expected task volume and growth trajectory over the next 12 months?

These clarifications will help finalize the non-functional requirements and guide infrastructure planning decisions.
