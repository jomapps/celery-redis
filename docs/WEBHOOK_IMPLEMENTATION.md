# Webhook Callback Implementation Summary

## Overview

This document summarizes the implementation of webhook callback functionality for the AI Movie Task Service. The webhook system automatically notifies external services when tasks complete (successfully or with failure).

## What Was Implemented

### 1. Webhook Utility Module (`app/utils/webhook.py`)

A comprehensive webhook utility module with the following features:

#### Functions:
- **`send_webhook_async()`**: Asynchronous webhook delivery with retry logic
- **`send_webhook_sync()`**: Synchronous wrapper for Celery task context
- **`build_success_webhook_payload()`**: Standardized success payload builder
- **`build_failure_webhook_payload()`**: Standardized failure payload builder

#### Features:
- ✅ Automatic retry with exponential backoff (3 retries)
- ✅ 30-second timeout per request
- ✅ Comprehensive error handling
- ✅ Structured logging for debugging
- ✅ Support for custom metadata passthrough

### 2. Base Task Integration (`app/tasks/base_task.py`)

Updated the `BaseTaskWithBrain` class to automatically send webhooks:

#### Changes:
- **`on_success()` hook**: Now sends webhook on successful task completion
- **`on_failure()` hook**: Now sends webhook on task failure
- Both hooks extract `callback_url` from task kwargs
- Metadata is passed through to webhook payload

#### Behavior:
- Webhooks are only sent if `callback_url` is provided in task submission
- Webhook sending happens after brain service storage
- Errors in webhook delivery don't affect task completion status
- All webhook attempts are logged for monitoring

### 3. Comprehensive Test Suite (`tests/test_webhook_integration.py`)

Created 12 comprehensive tests covering:

#### Test Categories:
1. **Payload Builders** (4 tests)
   - Basic success payload
   - Success payload with metadata
   - Basic failure payload
   - Failure payload with traceback

2. **Webhook Sending** (5 tests)
   - Successful delivery
   - Retry on failure
   - No URL handling
   - Timeout handling
   - Synchronous wrapper

3. **Task Integration** (3 tests)
   - Task success triggers webhook
   - Task failure triggers webhook
   - No webhook when URL not provided

#### Test Results:
```
12 passed, 10 warnings in 2.61s
```

### 4. Documentation

Created comprehensive documentation:

- **`docs/webhook-callbacks.md`**: Complete user guide with examples
- **`docs/WEBHOOK_IMPLEMENTATION.md`**: This implementation summary

## How It Works

### Flow Diagram

```
Task Submission (with callback_url)
         ↓
Task Execution (Celery Worker)
         ↓
Task Completes (Success or Failure)
         ↓
on_success() or on_failure() hook triggered
         ↓
Store result in Brain Service
         ↓
Extract callback_url from kwargs
         ↓
Build webhook payload
         ↓
Send webhook (with retries)
         ↓
Log delivery status
```

### Webhook Payload Examples

#### Success:
```json
{
  "task_id": "abc123-def456-ghi789",
  "project_id": "detective_series_001",
  "status": "completed",
  "result": {
    "media_url": "https://media.ft.tc/video.mp4",
    "payload_media_id": "64f1b2c3a8d9e0f1"
  },
  "processing_time": 315,
  "completed_at": "2025-01-15T10:35:30Z",
  "metadata": {
    "userId": "user-123"
  }
}
```

#### Failure:
```json
{
  "task_id": "abc123-def456-ghi789",
  "project_id": "detective_series_001",
  "status": "failed",
  "error": "Task execution failed",
  "traceback": "Traceback...",
  "failed_at": "2025-01-15T10:35:30Z",
  "metadata": {
    "userId": "user-123"
  }
}
```

## Usage Example

### Submitting a Task with Callback

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8001/api/v1/tasks/submit \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "X-API-Key: your-api-key" \
  -d '{
    "project_id": "test_project",
    "task_type": "video_generation",
    "callback_url": "https://your-app.com/api/webhooks/task-complete",
    "parameters": {
      "prompt": "Generate video"
    },
    "metadata": {
      "userId": "user-123"
    }
  }'
```

### Handling the Webhook (Node.js)

```javascript
app.post('/api/webhooks/task-complete', express.json(), async (req, res) => {
  const { task_id, status, result, error } = req.body;
  
  if (status === 'completed') {
    console.log(`Task ${task_id} completed:`, result);
    // Update your database, notify user, etc.
  } else if (status === 'failed') {
    console.error(`Task ${task_id} failed:`, error);
    // Handle failure
  }
  
  res.status(200).json({ received: true });
});
```

## Technical Details

### Dependencies

- **httpx**: For async HTTP requests
- **asyncio**: For async/sync coordination
- **structlog**: For structured logging

### Retry Strategy

- **Attempts**: 3 retries (4 total attempts including initial)
- **Backoff**: Exponential (1s, 2s, 4s)
- **Timeout**: 30 seconds per attempt
- **Success codes**: 200, 201, 202, 204

### Error Handling

- Network errors: Logged and retried
- Timeouts: Logged and retried
- Non-success status codes: Logged and retried
- All retries exhausted: Logged as error, task still succeeds

## Integration Points

### 1. Task Submission API
- Accepts `callback_url` parameter (optional)
- Validates URL format (must be HTTP/HTTPS)
- Stores callback_url in task kwargs

### 2. Celery Task Execution
- `BaseTaskWithBrain.on_success()` sends success webhook
- `BaseTaskWithBrain.on_failure()` sends failure webhook
- Webhook sending is non-blocking

### 3. Brain Service
- Task results stored before webhook sent
- Webhook failures don't affect brain storage
- Results queryable even if webhook fails

## Monitoring and Debugging

### Log Messages

**Success:**
```
INFO: Webhook sent successfully callback_url=https://... status_code=200 task_id=...
```

**Retry:**
```
WARNING: Webhook request failed callback_url=https://... error=... attempt=1
```

**Failure:**
```
ERROR: Failed to send webhook after all retries callback_url=https://... max_retries=3 task_id=...
```

### Checking Logs

```bash
# View all webhook-related logs
docker logs celery-redis-api-1 | grep "webhook"

# View webhook failures only
docker logs celery-redis-api-1 | grep "Failed to send webhook"
```

## Testing

### Run Tests

```bash
# Run webhook tests
python3 -m pytest tests/test_webhook_integration.py -v

# Run with coverage
python3 -m pytest tests/test_webhook_integration.py --cov=app.utils.webhook --cov-report=html
```

### Manual Testing

1. Start a webhook receiver (e.g., ngrok + local server)
2. Submit a task with callback_url
3. Monitor logs for webhook delivery
4. Verify payload received at webhook endpoint

## Security Considerations

### Current Implementation
- No authentication on webhook requests
- HTTPS recommended but not enforced
- No signature verification

### Recommended for Production
1. **IP Whitelisting**: Restrict webhook sources
2. **HTTPS Only**: Enforce HTTPS for callback URLs
3. **Signature Verification**: Add HMAC signatures (future)
4. **Rate Limiting**: Prevent webhook abuse

## Future Enhancements

### Planned Features
- [ ] HMAC signature verification
- [ ] Configurable retry policy
- [ ] Webhook delivery status tracking
- [ ] Dead letter queue for failed webhooks
- [ ] Webhook replay functionality
- [ ] Batch webhook delivery
- [ ] Custom headers support

### Potential Improvements
- [ ] Webhook delivery metrics (Prometheus)
- [ ] Webhook delivery dashboard
- [ ] Webhook testing UI
- [ ] Webhook event filtering
